## ALGORRITHM
This program demonstrates two searching algorithms: Ternary Search and Interpolation Search, implemented in C++.

##  Ternary Search

Ternary Search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used on sorted arrays. Unlike Binary Search, which divides the range into two halves, Ternary Search divides it into three parts.

### How it works:

1. Two midpoints are calculated within the current search range.
2. The target value is compared with the elements at both midpoints.
3. Based on the comparison:
   - If the target matches either midpoint, the search ends.
   - If the target is less than the first midpoint, the search continues in the leftmost third.
   - If the target is greater than the second midpoint, the search continues in the rightmost third.
   - Otherwise, it searches the middle third.
4. This process repeats until the element is found or the search range becomes invalid.

### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1)
- Average and Worst Case: O(logâ‚ƒ N), which is logarithmic like binary search but slightly slower due to more comparisons.

## Interpolation Search

Interpolation Search is an improved search method used on sorted arrays with uniformly distributed values. It estimates the position of the target based on the values, rather than just splitting the array.

## How it works:

1. The algorithm calculates a probable position using the formula based on proportional value distribution.
2. It checks the value at the estimated position:
   - If it matches the target, the search ends.
   - If the target is larger, it shifts the lower bound up.
   - If the target is smaller, it shifts the upper bound down.
3. The process repeats until the target is found or the search interval becomes invalid.

## Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1)
- Average Case: O(log log N)
- Worst Case: O(N), especially when data is not uniformly distributed
